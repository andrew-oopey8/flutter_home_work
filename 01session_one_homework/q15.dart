// Question 15
// What does it mean for Dart to be a statically-typed language, and how does it impact the way variables are used?

// In programming, a statically-typed language like Dart means that the type of a variable (e.g., int, String, bool) is known and checked at compile time, rather than at runtime. This is in contrast to dynamically-typed languages, where types are determined at runtime.
